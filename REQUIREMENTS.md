## Operating System & Hardware
We recommend using machines equipped with at least 8 cores, 16GB RAM, and ~30GB available disk space with **Ubuntu 22.04** to stably reproduce the experimental results in our paper.  

## Software

- We develop RCAEval using Python 3.8 and 3.10.
- We encourage user to create a virtual environment to use RCAEval (e.g., `python3.10 -m venv env-dev`).
- RCAEval could be installed using pip. (e.g., `pip install RCAEval`).
- RCAEval requires the packages described in [requirements.lock](requirements.lock) and [requirements_rcd.lock](requirements_rcd.lock), depending on which methods are used.
