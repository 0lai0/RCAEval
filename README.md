## Download Experimental Data \& Supplementary Material

You can download our supplementary material and all the data we used for this research from this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BG2P1ETEyKW62dU0I1ZpE64Ng9fy5_ju?usp=sharing).

## Installation

We maintain 3 environments for different methods that could be installed easily as follows.

### OS & Hardware requirements
- Ubuntu 22.04
- 8 CPU, 16GB RAM, 30GB free disk.

### Pre-installation

Open your terminal and run commands
```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y build-essential \
  libxml2 libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev \
  python3-tk graphviz

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt-get install -y python3.8 python3.8-dev python3.8-venv
sudo apt-get install -y python3.10 python3.10-dev python3.10-venv
```

### Install the Dev environment
By installing this environment, you can run the following:
- PC-based, FCI-based, LiNGAM-based, GES-based
- CausalRCA
- CIRCA, Nsigma, Dummy

```bash
python3.10 -m venv env-dev
. env-dev/bin/activate
pip install pip==20.0.2
pip install -e .[dev]
```


### Install the RCD environment
By installing this environment, you can run the RCD algorithm

```bash
python3.8 -m venv env-rcd
. env-rcd/bin/activate
pip install pip==20.0.2
pip install -e .[rcd]
bash script/link.sh
```

### Install the fGES environment
By installing this environment, you can run the fGES-based algorithm

```bash
python3.8 -m venv env-fges
. env-fges/bin/activate

pip install pip==20.0.2
pip install -e .[rcd]

cd LIB
pip install -e .
cd ..

# it MUST be performed in this order
sudo apt-get install -y gcc graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config
pip install dill pygobnilp
pip install -U numba
pip install category_encoders sortedcontainers fcit
pip install pgmpy
pip install feature_engine
```

## Reproducibility

### Reproduce RQ1 - Causal Discovery Performance

To reproduce the causal discovery performance, as presented in Table 3. You can download the corresponding dataset and extracted to folder `./data`. Then, you can run the file `graph_eval.py` to obtain the results for one iteration. For example:

As presented in Table 3, PC achieves F1, F1-S, and SHD of 0.49, 0.65, and 16 on the CIRCA 10 dataset. To reproduce this results as presented in the Table 3. You can run the following commands:

```bash
python graph_eval.py -i data/syn_circa/10 -m pc -w 5
```

The expected output should be exactly as presented in the paper (it takes around 1 minute to run the code)

```
F1:   0.49
F1-S: 0.65
SHD:  16
```

We can replace the method `pc` and dataset `syn_circa/10` to replicate corresponding results.



### Reproduce RQ2 - Root Cause Analysis Performance

To reproduce the root cause analysis performance, as presented in Table 5. You can download the corresponding dataset and extracted to folder `./data`. Then, you can run the file `eval.py` to reproduce the results. For example:


As presented in Table 5, NSigma [ $t_\Delta = 0$ ] achieves Avg@5 of 0.94, 1, 0.9, 0.98, and 0.67 for CPU, MEM, DISK, DELAY, and LOSS fault types on the Online Boutique dataset. To reproduce the RCA performance of NSigma [ $t_\Delta = 0$ ] as presented in the Table 5. You can run the following commands:

```bash
python eval.py -i data/online-boutique -o output-tmp -m nsigma --iter-num 10 -w 10 --length 10
```

<details>
<summary>Expected output after running the above code (it takes around 1 minute)</summary>

<br />

The results are exactly as presented in the paper (Table 5).
```
Evaluation results
s_cpu: 0.94
s_mem: 1.0
s_disk: 0.9
s_delay: 0.98
s_loss: 0.67
```
</details>

As presented in Table 5, NSigma [ $t_\Delta = 60$ ] achieves Avg@5 of 0.16, 0.24, 0.43, 0.55, and 0.38 for CPU, MEM, DISK, DELAY, and LOSS fault types on the Online Boutique dataset. To reproduce the RCA performance of NSigma [ $t_\Delta = 60$ ] as presented in the Table 5. You can run the following commands:

```bash
python eval.py -i data/online-boutique -o output-tmp -m nsigma --iter-num 10 -w 10 --length 10 --ad-delay 60
```

<details>
<summary>Expected output after running the above code (it takes around 1 minute)</summary>

<br />

The results are exactly as presented in the paper (Table 5).
```
Evaluation results
s_cpu: 0.16
s_mem: 0.24
s_disk: 0.43
s_delay: 0.55
s_loss: 0.38
```
</details>


We can replace the method `nsigma` by `baro`, `pc_pagerank`, `fci_pagerank`, `rcd`, `e_diagnosis`, etc. to replicate corresponding results.

### Reproduce RQ3 - Efficiency

The efficiency is captured in our evaluation script and saved in the corresponding output directory.

### Reproduce RQ4 - Data lengths

Our RQ4 relies on the scripts of RQ1 and RQ2, which we presented above.
